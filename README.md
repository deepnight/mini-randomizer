# RPG randomizer

## About

A simple tool to generate things for tabletop RPGs. For example, it can be used to generate random locations in a post-apocalyptic, random encounters or loots.

This tool was inspired by *RandomGen* from Orteil (https://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/). Fun fact: I developed a very similar tech years ago, for the hacking game "Intrusion" (https://deepnight.net/games/motion-twin/intrusion/), to generate file contents in hacked computers.
